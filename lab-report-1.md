# `cd`
> ## 1. No Arguments

The first example is using the command `cd` with no arguments. When this is run, it will return the user to the home directory, which in this case takes the user back from Documents to home. This is because since the `cd` command lacks an argument, it cannot directed anywhere besides the home directory.

The second example is using the command `cd` with a path to directory as an argument. When using a path to directory as an argument using the command `cd`, it will change the working directory to the desired directory. In this case, it is downloads. It can be seen that when we used `cd downloads` the working directory changed to Downloads as it is our desired working directory.

The last example is using the command `cd` with a path to a file as an argument. Doing this, a series of directories will be listed where we can then choose which one we want to open. Above, I chose to open my OneDrive, leading to the files in it, and I chose to open Attachments. Because of this, I was able to open the file and access the contents in it.

# `ls`

The first example is using the command `ls` with no arguments. When no arguments are provided with `ls`, it will return the list of files in the current directory in alphabetical order. This is because there is no specific directory that it is being asked to list the files of, so instead it displays everything accessible to the user in the home directory.

The second example is using the command `ls` with a path to directory as an argument. When this is run, it will show the user the contents of the directory that was called upon. In this example, it is being asked to list the files in links and displays it to the user. This is because the user is being more specific in referencing a directory using `ls` compared to using it with no arguments.

The last example is using the command `ls` with a path to a file as an argument. In this case, the command `ls` opened the contents in 'Documents' and further into 'Videos'. As a result of this, the user is able to see the directory and files under Documents and the file that is stored in it labeled 'Videos'.

# `cat`

The first example is using the command `cat` with no arguments. When the 'cat' is used with no arguments, it reads the data from the input and composes it to the output. In the picture above, this is exemplified the program took the user input 'cse15l' and outputted 'cse15l' as well. This occurs because there is no argument used in the original `cat` command, so the input the user types becomes the standard input

The second example is using the command `cat with a path to directory as an argument.

The last example is using the command `cat` with a path to a file as an argument. This will concatenate the various files that are specified, leading to enabling the user to view or integrate the output to another file. The picture above illustrates !!!
